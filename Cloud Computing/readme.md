Cloud Computing & Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
1. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet instead of using physical on-premise machines.

Real-life example:
Just like we pay Airtel/Jio for data usage instead of owning the telecom infrastructure, companies use cloud services on a pay-as-you-use model.

2.  Why Do We Need Cloud?
Before Cloud (On-Premise Challenges)

❌ High upfront hardware cost

❌ Scaling is difficult and expensive

❌ Underutilized machines during low usage

❌ Dedicated teams needed for updates, security, and maintenance

❌ Complex backup & disaster recovery setup

After Cloud (Benefits)

✅ Pay only for what you use

✅ Scale instantly as per demand

✅ High reliability and global availability

✅ Better security with automatic updates

✅ Faster development & deployment

3. 🏢 How Cloud Helps IT Companies

Reduces infrastructure and operational costs

Enables rapid innovation and faster time-to-market

Provides access to modern tech (AI, ML, Big Data, IoT)

Improves performance and application availability

Lets teams focus on product development instead of server management

4. Major Cloud Providers

Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Largest cloud provider

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – Strong in analytics, AI & networking

Microsoft Azure – Popular in enterprise and Microsoft ecosystem

5.  Why Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?
a. Strong in Data & Analytics
