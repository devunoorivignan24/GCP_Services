Cloud Computing & Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

 1. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet rather than using on-premise hardware.

 Real-Life Example:

Just as we pay Airtel/Jio for data usage instead of owning telecom infrastructure, companies also use cloud services in a pay-as-you-use model.

 2. Why Do We Need Cloud?
❗ Before Cloud — On-Premise Challenges

❌ High upfront hardware cost

❌ Scaling is difficult and expensive

❌ Underutilized hardware during low demand

❌ Requires dedicated teams for updates, maintenance & security

❌ Complex backup and disaster recovery

✔️ After Cloud — Benefits

✅ Pay only for what you use

✅ Scale instantly with demand

✅ Highly reliable with global availability

✅ Better security & automatic updates

✅ Faster development and deployment

 3. How Cloud Helps IT Companies

- Reduces infrastructure & operational costs

- Enables rapid innovation and faster time-to-market

- Provides access to AI, ML, Big Data, IoT technologies

- Improves application performance & availability

- Lets teams focus on product development, not server management

 4. Major Cloud Providers

    -> Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Largest and most mature cloud platform

    -> Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – Leader in analytics, AI, and global networking

    -> Microsoft Azure – Best for enterprise and Microsoft ecosystem

 5. Why Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?
 a. Strong in Data & Analytics

- BigQuery → ultra-fast, scalable, serverless analytics

- Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Dataproc → real-time data pipeline tools

 b. Leadership in AI & ML

- Vertex AI → end-to-end ML lifecycle platform

- Pre-built models for NLP, Vision, Speech

- Native support for TensorFlow (created by Google)

 c. Cost-Effective Solutions

- Automatic Sustained Use Discounts

- Committed Use Discounts

- Preemptible VMs for low-cost compute workloads

 Conclusion

Cloud computing simplifies infrastructure management and boosts innovation speed.
Among cloud providers, GCP stands out due to its strengths in data analytics, AI, and cost efficiency, making it a smart choice for modern applications.
